# Surveying the Landscape of Environmental Social Science: A Bibliometric and Network Analysis

This is the replication package for the manuscript "Surveying the Landscape of Environmental Social Science: A Bibliometric and Network Analysis" by [Nicholas G. Theis](https://cas.uoregon.edu/directory/sociology/all/ntheis) and [Ryan Light](https://ryanlight.netlify.app/). From the abstract of the paper:

Social science research on the environment has grown exponentially in the past four decades
alongside increasing awareness that environmental risks, such as climate change, cannot be
understood by natural science interventions alone. While prior research examines how specific
disciplines, like sociology, have attended to the environment or how specific problems have been
engaged across disciplines, less attention has been offered to the entire landscape of research on
the environment in the social sciences. In this article, we ask: What is the landscape of
environmental social science? Focusing on 124,906 social scientific articles from the Web of
Science, we analyze the relationship between journals publishing research on the environment.
Specifically, we construct journal citation networks and topic models on bibliographic records
from 1990 to 2022. Results suggest that journals form coherent communities associated with
both disciplinary and interdisciplinary research topics, indicating that journal communities may
be a central organizing feature of ESS. Moreover, research topics prevalent in this field have
changed over time, potentially in relation to the ongoing neoliberalization of climate change
politics. As scholars want to influence policy and industrial practice, their research implicitly
reflects values consistent with the current political economic order. We conclude by highlighting
the implications of these findings for the field of environmental social science.

The analysis is done exclusively in R. All code to reproduce the analysis is available in the `scripts` subdirectory. Data that does not reproduce third-party data is available in the `data` repository. Most of the analysis can be replicated with these data.
